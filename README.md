# Objective
This is the third project of the series on **Computational Statistics in Business Analytics (CSBA)**. The primary goal of this project is to explore and demonstrate the concept and application of confidence intervals in statistical analysis. This involves understanding how confidence intervals are constructed and interpreted, especially in the context of sample data drawn from larger populations. The project aims to provide insights into the reliability and variability of sample estimates, showcasing the importance of confidence intervals in data-driven decision-making.

# Dataset
We use a synthetic dataset in this project.

# Tasks

## 1. Data Standardization and Exploration
* Standardize a synthetic dataset.
* Analyze the standardized data.

## 2. Confidence Intervals Simulation
* Display confidence intervals of a 100 samples (each of size 100), generated from a normally distributed population of 10,000.
* Rerun the previous simulation with the same number of samples, but increase the sample size to 300. Visualize the confidence intervals.
*
