# Objective
This is the third project of the series on **Computational Statistics in Business Analytics (CSBA)**. The primary goal of this project is to explore and demonstrate the concept and application of confidence intervals in statistical analysis. This involves understanding how confidence intervals are constructed and interpreted, especially in the context of sample data drawn from larger populations. The project aims to provide insights into the reliability and variability of sample estimates, showcasing the importance of confidence intervals in data-driven decision-making.

# Dataset
The data for this project is an artificial dataset that revolves around restaurant bookings. It includes data points representing the times of day that new members make their first restaurant booking through an online platform. The dataset is structured to capture the specific minute of the day (ranging from 0 to 1440) when each booking was made.
